Cross Compiling for Windows CEÂ¶
Cross compiling for Windows CE requires the corresponding SDK being installed on your system. These SDKs are usually installed under C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows CE Tools/SDKs.

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for Windows CE may look like this:

set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsCE)

set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.0)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET CE800) # Can be omitted for 8.0
set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM SDK_AM335X_SK_WEC2013_V310)
The CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM tells the generator which SDK to use. Further CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION tells the generator what version of Windows CE to use. Currently version 8.0 (Windows Embedded Compact 2013) is supported out of the box. Other versions may require one to set CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET to the correct value.

Cross Compiling for Windows 10 Universal Applications
A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for a Windows 10 Universal Application may look like this:

set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsStore)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 10.0)
A Windows 10 Universal Application targets both Windows Store and Windows Phone. Specify the CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION variable to be 10.0 to build with the latest available Windows 10 SDK. Specify a more specific version (e.g. 10.0.10240.0 for RTM) to build with the corresponding SDK.

add support for clang port

check out if building for mobile/store is possible with MinGW

replace CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR with
